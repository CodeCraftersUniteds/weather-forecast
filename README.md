If you need to add an API_KEY, you must visit the openweathermap.org website and sign up to get the API key. 
Here is the link to get the API key: https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys 

Then, you need to use that API_KEY instead of the 'process.env' part in the code. 
Alternatively, you can rename the '.env.example' file to '.env' and add the generated API key there.
